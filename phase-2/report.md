## Project report - Phase-2 | project00

Completing Phase-2 of `Project00`  helped me combine techniques used in computational linguistics with that of data visualisation. Phase-2 involved myself writing a computational linguistics module that computes the semantic proximity of a certain text with that of a text label. Specifically, I wanted the ‘Reason’ column to be categorised broadly into four types namely, “label_class, label_food, label_leisure, label_work”. The labels are self explanatory and there were some rows in the ‘Reason’ column that couldn’t appropriately be attached to the aforementioned labels, hence they became Null values. The difference with Phase-2 was two fold. On one hand I have a dataset where many columns that could potentially act as a meta data providing greater context into users actions had to be dropped, whilst on the other hand I have homogeneous data about 25 users. This was a challenge to me because I had to come up with a way for adding more columns to the dataset. Prototyping for this phase actually helped in building the final visualisation. The idea to categorise every reason the user enters a building was first sketched on the paper. Developing the computational linguistics module that computed the semantic proximity between the four labels and the reason was the toughest thing in Phase-2.
