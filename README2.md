# Project00 Data Collection and Visualization (Phase 2)

## Project Description
This phase begins with the sharing of the data you collected in phase 1. In addition to the collected data, you will share your major and year in school. You will receive other datasets along with the additional information.  You are responsible for developing an integrated visualization that includes all datasets you are given. You will produce at least five visualization prototypes (simple hand-drawings) in your course notebook, you will then self-critique the prototypes and pick a final visualization (computer generated) of the data for grading.

## Potential Resources:

- Lynda.com for tools

- [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject)

## Learning Outcomes
- The process of dealing with data from other sources and organizing data.
- Evaluation data and benefits of prototyping in visualization.
- Application of visualization best practices.

# Class Project Requirements

There are multiple required components to the class project (and 2 phases), phase 1 has been completed and the phase 2 breakdown is described in more detail below. 

- Project Prototypes and Data Manipulation [45%]
- Project Execution [45%]
- Project Report [10%]

This effort represents 50% of project00 grade, phase 1 represented the other half.

## Project Prototypes and Data Manipulation [45%]
This phase and component requires the integration of multiple data sources to construct a unified visualization. You will be provided datasets in the form captured by your classmates.  You must use ~90% of the sources that you are provided. This means for undergraduates you must use 7 of the 8 datasets, graduate students you must use 24 of the 27 datasets.  This means you may remove at least one problematic dataset from your visualization. You may summarize/simplifying the data; for example, if you have datasets where people are at the **Student Center** and the reason they are there is *having a coffee*, *drinking tea*, *grabbing a soft drink* - you can simplify those to say *getting beverage*. Yes, this means you might be doing some hand editing of data.

## Project Execution [40%] 
Once you have organized your data and decided based on prototypes which visualization you plan to produce you will produce the final visualization for phase 1 using a computer based tool, be it photoshop or d3.js, it can be any tool you want to use but it must produce a single static visualization that is of sufficient resolution to see detail and reproduce in print form. For undergraduates you will now have a visualization of *A Week at NIU Buildings for Undergraduate Data Visualization Students* and graduate students *A Week at NIU Buildings for Graduate Data Visualization Students*.

## Project Report [10%] 
You will write a phase 2 project report, this report need not be long but will be longer than phase 1 and should answer questions such as:

- What did you learn as part of this exercise?
- How different was phase 2 from phase 1?
- How did the prototyping help you, did it influence your data organization?
- What did you have to do different in phase 2 from phase 1?
- What was the biggest challenge in phase 2?

This can be as short as two paragraphs to as long as one page and you must use good grammar and spelling.
